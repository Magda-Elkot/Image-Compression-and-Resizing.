### 1. Introduction
This project involves various image processing tasks implemented in Python from scratch. It includes operations such as histogram plotting, JPEG compression, upsampling, and downsampling using different interpolation methods.

### 2. Histogram
Histograms are visual representations of the distribution of pixel intensities in an image. We convert the image to an array and calculate histograms for each color channel (red, green, and blue). Then, we plot these histograms to analyze the distribution of pixel values.

### 3. Task 1: JPEG Compression
In this task, we perform JPEG compression on the image with varying quality levels. We measure metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) to evaluate the compression quality.

### 4. Task 2: Upsampling
Upsampling involves increasing the resolution or size of an image. We implement Nearest Neighbor Interpolation, Bilinear Interpolation, and Bicubic Interpolation methods to perform upsampling. These methods are compared, and resulting images are visualized.

### 5. Task 3: Downsampling
Downsampling refers to reducing the resolution or size of an image. We implement downsampling using different techniques such as Nearest Neighbor Interpolation, Average Pooling, and Max Pooling. The resulting images are compared and displayed.

For detailed implementation and code, refer to the provided Python script.
